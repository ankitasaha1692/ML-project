# ML-project on Determining match/mismatch between job skills and Universities curriculum in top 10 Universities in Europe.

This study aimed to analyze the match between university curriculum and job postings in Europe. The background highlighted the importance of aligning university education with industry needs to reduce skill mismatches and increase employability. The study identified employers' skills and compared them with university skills to determine the extent of the match. The methodology involved two datasets: university curriculum and job postings in Europe. Exploratory data analysis was conducted on both datasets to gain insights into the distribution of programs, courses, and job postings. It revealed the top skills required by employers, the top courses offered by universities, and the top job roles available in different locations in Europe. The data analysis was conducted using Python. The results showed that there is a significant mismatch between university skills and employers' skills. Employers require skills in project management, data engineering, and data analysis. Universities, however, taught database management, computer science, and data structure based on outdated curriculum. There was also a significant difference in the distribution of job postings across different locations, with Brussels having the highest number of job postings. The study highlights the need for universities to align their curriculum with industry needs to reduce skill mismatches and increase employability. It also emphasizes the importance of data analysis and visualization tools in gaining insights into complex datasets.

About the datasets:
The data used in this research project are University programs and job postings across Europe. Data availability was challenging as datasets were not pre-made and easily available. Created the university programs dataset from the official websites of the top 10 European universities. Retrieved their program information and the corresponding courses for each program. Created the Europe Remote job postings dataset by web crawling tool -  Octoparse. The datasets contain categorical data.
